Introduction to dynamic data structures  that can grow and shrink at execution time
1. Linked lists:  Insertion and deletion made anywhere in a linked list
2. Stacks: Insertion and deletion made only at one end of a stack - its top.
3. Queues: waiting lines; Insertion only at the back(tail) and deletion are
   made only from the front(Head) of the queue.
